# Synapse-seq (*Dolan et al., 2025*) â€“ Code and Vignettes

**Synapse-seq** is a suite of technologies designed to measure both single-neuron molecular expression profiles and long-range neuroanatomical projections. The **pre-synaptic system** enables detection of distal projections, making it possible to analyze how a neuron's transcriptomic identity relates to its projection behavior.

## ðŸ“˜ Vignettes

This repository provides walkthroughs for key analytical components of Synapse-seq.  
We recommend starting with the **presynaptic vignette**, which characterizes **cortico-thalamic projections from the primary visual cortex (VISp)**.
